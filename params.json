The primary purpose of this script is to fetch and display header information; in particular date, from and subject of emails; in the chosen folder in each account (INBOX by default) without having to download entire emails.\r\n\r\nHere are a few screenshots:\r\n\r\n_fetchheaders run with default settings. It takes fetchheaders less than a second to download header information from 3 different IMAP email accounts:_\r\n\r\n![screenshot: fetchheaders (default)](https://github.com/abid-mujtaba/fetchheaders/blob/gh-pages/images/fetchheaders%20screenshot.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n_fetchheaders displaying both seen and unseen messages:_\r\n\r\n![screenshot: fetchheaders -A](https://github.com/abid-mujtaba/fetchheaders/blob/gh-pages/images/fetchheaders%20all%20screenshot.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n_fetchheaders displaying only number of messages (analogous to 'fetchmail -c') but note that it takes it only 0.56 seconds:_\r\n\r\n![screenshot: fetchheaders -n](https://github.com/abid-mujtaba/fetchheaders/blob/gh-pages/images/fetchheaders%20-n%20screenshot.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n_fetchheaders displaying all email headers with mutt-style flags:_\r\n\r\n![screenshot: fetchheaders -A --showFlags](https://github.com/abid-mujtaba/fetchheaders/blob/gh-pages/images/fetchheaders%20flags%20screenshot.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n**Note:** This program can only access IMAP servers which allow SSL-based access over port 443.\r\n\r\nNote: This program was written using Python 2.7 on an Ubuntu 12.04 machine. It hasn't been tested on different versions of Python or different OSes but is expected to behave properly on different systems.\r\n\r\nTo set up account access fill in the configuration file ~/.fetchheaders/fetchheaders.conf. One can create multiple configuration files and refer to a particular one using the -c switch when calling the fetchheaders.py script. Run 'fetchheaders.py -h' for details.\r\n\r\nDefault behaviour is set up in the configuration file.\r\n\r\nThe configuration behaviour can be over-ridden by passing command-line arguments when the fetchheaders script is called. Run 'fetchheaders -h' to get a list of the command-line arguments. \r\n\r\n\r\nIf called with the -n switch the program will return only the number of emails in the default folder (number of unseen message and the total number of messages) similar to fetchmail's -c switch.\r\n\r\n\r\n**For more details please read the man page.**\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to email the author of the program if problems arise.\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthor: Abid H.
