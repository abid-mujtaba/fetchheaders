Installation Instructions:

Install from Source:


	It is recommended that one download the tar-ball and confirm the md5sum (or sha256) hash as well as the signature of the archive.


	Create the folder $HOME/.fetchheaders (~/.fetchheaders).


	After having extracted the tar-ball move the configuration and specification files (fetchheaders.conf and fetchheaders.conf.spec) to $HOME/.fetchheaders.


	The .py files (fetchheaders.py, imapServer.py and miscClasses.py) must be kept in the same folder. $HOME/.fetchheaders can be used for this purpose.


	It is customary to make the fetchheaders.py folder executable.

		Example: In Ubuntu run:
			
			chmod +x ~/.fetchheaders/fetchheaders.py


	Create a symbolic link to fetchheaders.py and place it in an appropriate folder in the system path ($PATH) for example /usr/local/bin/.
		
		Example: In Ubuntu to create a symbolic link for the file ~/.fetchheaders/fetchheaders.py in /usr/local/bin run:

			sudo ln -s ~/.fetchheaders/fetchheaders.py /usr/local/bin/fetchheaders

			This will allow one to simply run the command 'fetchheaders' from any terminal or bash script to launch the program. Alternately one can place an alias in ~/.bashrc
