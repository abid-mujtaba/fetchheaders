# This file contains instructions on installing and uninstalling 'fetchheaders'. The recommened technique is to use make. For available options run 'make help'.
#
# Note: Any commands (including make commands) that require copying or deleting files in folders accessible only by root must be run as root. In Ubuntu this corresponds to prefacing said commands with 'sudo'.


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:


Install from Source (using make):

	For a brand new install run:

		make install
		sudo make install_binary

	To over-write the configuration files (to create clean configuration files):

		make config

	For details on all available make options:

		make help

	Note: 	To install the binary (symbolic link actually) to a location other that /usr/local/bin change the BIN_LOCATION variable at the top of the Makefile.
		
		To NOT install the manpage change the value of the CREATE_MANPAGE variable to 0.



Install from Source (manual):


	Create the folder $HOME/.fetchheaders (~/.fetchheaders).


	After having extracted the tar-ball move the configuration and specification files (fetchheaders.conf and fetchheaders.conf.spec) to $HOME/.fetchheaders.


	The .py files (fetchheaders.py, imapServer.py and miscClasses.py) must be kept in the same folder. $HOME/.fetchheaders can be used for this purpose.


	It is customary to make the fetchheaders.py folder executable.

		Example: In Ubuntu run:
			
			chmod +x ~/.fetchheaders/fetchheaders.py


	Create a symbolic link to fetchheaders.py and place it in an appropriate folder in the system path ($PATH) for example /usr/local/bin/.
		
		Example: In Ubuntu to create a symbolic link for the file ~/.fetchheaders/fetchheaders.py in /usr/local/bin run:

			sudo ln -s ~/.fetchheaders/fetchheaders.py /usr/local/bin/fetchheaders

			This will allow one to simply run the command 'fetchheaders' from any terminal or bash script to launch the program. Alternately one can place an alias in ~/.bashrc
	
	
	To install the man page copy fetchheaders.1.gz in to /usr/share/man/man1/

		Example: In Ubuntu one would need to use sudo (root privelleges) to copy the file:

			sudo cp ~/.fetchheaders/fetchheaders.1.gz /usr/share/man/man1/




UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:


Uninstall (using make):

	To remove all files except configuration files:

		sudo make uninstall

	To remove all files including the configuration files:

		sudo make purge



Uninstall (manual):

	Simply delete all files from ~/.fetchheaders with the possible exception of fetchheaders.conf and fetchheaders.conf.spec

	Delete /usr/local/bin/fetchheaders

	Delete /usr/share/man/man1/fetchheaders.1.gz
